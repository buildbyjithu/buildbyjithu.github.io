# Updated Files for Successful Deployment

## What I Fixed
The deployment was failing because the UI components were missing their dependencies. I've now added all required packages to the client package.json.

## Upload These Updated Files to Your Repository

### 1. Delete everything in your GitHub repository first

### 2. Upload these files from the `client/` folder:
- `src/` (entire folder with all components and your profile photo)
- `index.html`
- `package.json` (NOW INCLUDES ALL DEPENDENCIES)
- `vite.config.ts`
- `tailwind.config.ts`
- `postcss.config.js`

### 3. Create workflow file:
`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
```yaml
name: Deploy Portfolio

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]

permissions:
  contents: read
  pages: write
  id-token: write

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20'
      
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install
      
      - name: Build
        run: npm run build
      
      - name: Setup Pages
        uses: actions/configure-pages@v4
      
      - name: Upload artifact
        uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3
        with:
          path: './dist'
      
      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        uses: actions/deploy-pages@v4
```

### 4. Enable GitHub Actions in Settings â†’ Pages

## Dependencies Now Included:
- All Radix UI components
- React Hook Form
- Zod validation
- Framer Motion
- All other required packages

Your portfolio will now deploy successfully to https://buildbyjithu.github.io
