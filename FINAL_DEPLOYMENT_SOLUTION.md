# Complete Solution for buildbyjithu.github.io

## Current Status
Your GitHub repository is showing Jekyll instead of your React portfolio. I've prepared all the corrected files.

## Upload These Files to Your Repository

### Delete Everything First
Go to your repository and delete all existing files.

### Upload Only These Files:

**From `client/` folder:**
- `src/` (entire folder with all components)
- `index.html`
- `package.json` (updated with correct dependencies)
- `vite.config.ts` (configured for standalone deployment)
- `tailwind.config.ts` (paths corrected for client folder)
- `postcss.config.js` (copied to correct location)

**Create this workflow file:**
`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
```yaml
name: Deploy Portfolio

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]

permissions:
  contents: read
  pages: write
  id-token: write

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20'
      
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install
      
      - name: Build
        run: npm run build
      
      - name: Setup Pages
        uses: actions/configure-pages@v4
      
      - name: Upload artifact
        uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3
        with:
          path: './dist'
      
      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        uses: actions/deploy-pages@v4
```

### Repository Structure Should Look Like:
```
buildbyjithu.github.io/
├── .github/workflows/deploy.yml
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   ├── assets/profile-photo.jpg
│   └── ...
├── index.html
├── package.json
├── vite.config.ts
├── tailwind.config.ts
└── postcss.config.js
```

### In GitHub Settings:
- Go to Settings → Pages
- Change Source to "GitHub Actions"

## What I Fixed:
- Moved config files to correct location
- Updated package.json with required dependencies
- Fixed tailwind paths for standalone deployment
- Changed workflow to use `npm install` instead of `npm ci`
- Added missing TailwindCSS plugins

Your portfolio will deploy correctly to https://buildbyjithu.github.io
