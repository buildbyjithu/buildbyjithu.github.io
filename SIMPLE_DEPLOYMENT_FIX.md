# Quick Fix for Your Portfolio Deployment

## The Issue
Your GitHub repository is showing Jekyll (README only) instead of your React portfolio.

## Simple Solution

### Option 1: Direct File Upload (Easiest)
1. **Delete everything** in your repository: https://github.com/buildbyjithu/buildbyjithu.github.io
2. **Upload only the client folder contents**:
   - Go to "Add file" → "Upload files"
   - Upload everything from the `client` folder
   - Also upload: `tailwind.config.ts`, `postcss.config.js`
3. **In Settings → Pages**: Change source to "GitHub Actions"
4. **Create workflow file**: `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` with this content:

```yaml
name: Deploy Portfolio

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]

permissions:
  contents: read
  pages: write
  id-token: write

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20'
      
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install
      
      - name: Build
        run: npm run build
      
      - name: Setup Pages
        uses: actions/configure-pages@v4
      
      - name: Upload artifact
        uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3
        with:
          path: './dist'
      
      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        uses: actions/deploy-pages@v4
```

### Option 2: Alternative - Static HTML Upload
1. Build the static files locally
2. Upload only the built files to your repository
3. Set GitHub Pages to deploy from main branch

## Result
Your portfolio with profile photo will be live at https://buildbyjithu.github.io

The key is removing all Jekyll-related files and using GitHub Actions for deployment.
