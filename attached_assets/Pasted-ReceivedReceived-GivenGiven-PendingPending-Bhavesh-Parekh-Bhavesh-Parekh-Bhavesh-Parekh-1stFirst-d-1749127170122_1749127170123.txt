I had the pleasure of working with Jithendra on multiple projects at Uptycs, including threat intelligence aggregation, vulnerability detection, and detection engines. I provided the requirements, and he consistently executed them with speed and precision. He played a crucial role in the MITRE ATT&CK Evaluations and was instrumental in laying the foundation for the detection graph within the product. Over the years, I’ve seen him grow from a Software Engineer to an Architect, a title he has truly earned through his technical expertise and problem-solving skills. His ability to turn ideas into impactful solutions is remarkable. I strongly recommend him.

Jithu is one of the smartest and most hard working full stack engineers and architects I have ever worked with. His understanding of various technologies like NodeJs, go, AWS, kubernetes, microservices etc. is amazing. His biggest superpower is to simplify a problem and help other visualize it before a solution could be reached. 
He also has exceptional design skills and he has developed entire cloud security product features and solutions singlehandedly from scratch. Not only he is aware of the bigger picture, he also knows where exactly in the code one should look and find a fix. 
Also, I don't know if he ever sleeps!

I have had the pleasure of working closely with Jithendranath Gupta during his time as a Software Architect at Uptycs, and I cannot recommend him highly enough. As one of the early employees, Jithendranath played a crucial role in building services from the ground up, shaping the company’s direction and contributing to its success.

Jithendranath has been a visionary when it comes to cloud telemetry. He led the charge on innovative features that brought real meaning to cloud infrastructure, particularly with AWS. His work on cloud discovery, resource exposure, attack path analysis, and risk determination laid the foundation for how our team approached cloud security.

He was instrumental in developing key endpoint and cloud security features, including detection engines, remediation engines, and integrations with platforms like Splunk and Slack. His deep technical expertise allowed him to work seamlessly across multiple layers of the stack while keeping the broader product vision intact.

Moreover, Jithendranath became the go-to person for prototyping any project or new initiative. His ability to rapidly iterate, scale, and deliver complex solutions made him a trusted figure in the team, always ensuring the success of critical projects.

Jithendranath is not just a brilliant architect, but also a true team player who consistently brought creative solutions to the table and made an indelible impact on the product. His technical acumen, dedication, and collaborative spirit are qualities that will make him an asset wherever he goes.

It was an absolute privilege to work with Jithendranath, and I look forward to seeing the incredible things he will continue to accomplish in his career.

Ever communicate a spec to a colleague, then wake up the next day to see it implemented? This was a common occurrence with Jithu over the several years we worked together at Uptycs. Jithu quickly became proficient with new technologies. It wasn’t long before he owned the implementation and maintenance of many of the services at Uptycs. In addition to being a skilled engineer, Jithu is kind and humble, always helping his colleagues where he could. Jithu would be a great addition to any team.

As a product manager, it was great working with Jithu. 

It is very hard to find people who are great developers but who also easily understand requirements, communicate well, and are able to organize work with multiple stakeholders.

Not only is he able to easily understand what needs to be achieved, he knows how to implement it well and is able to work on a lot of things at the same time. Throwing new technologies at him is never an issue either. If this was eBay ratings, I would say "A+++++ seller, would do business with again".

Jithu is a hardworking and dedicated developer. He’s always up for an new challenge and jumps into things with enthusiasm and thoughtfulness. I’ve seen him grow from a junior to a solid senior developer just in the short time we’ve worked together. Even though we spent most of that time across geographies, his kind and jovial personality came through the distance which helped with the challenges of working remotely.

Jithu picked up new technologies with ease and made significant contributions to the product and SaaS platform. He always delivered on or ahead of time. In spite of time zone difference he was available when necessary and proactively communicated with remote team members. Jithu would be an asset to any team and I highly recommend him.
